Revision history for Mallet-CrfWrapper

0.02    2014-06-03
        * Fix "WebService" method (make it work, remove mentions of Media
          Cloud).
        * Add unit tests for both the "InlineJava" and "WebService" CRF model
          runner methods.
        * "InlineJava": instead of fetching an array with Java objects, fetch
          a single string from Java class and parse it on Perl's side. This is
          needed in order to reduce Inline::Java usage to the minimum and thus
          speed up the model runner by 4x.
        * "WebService": instead of JSON, return a newline-and-space-separated
          plain text as a CRF model runner result. This is how it's being used
          in Inline::Java's case, so we can reuse the same helper subroutines
          and avoid encoding / decoding JSON.
        * Round probabilities to up to 8 digits after decimal point in order to
          make it comparable (thus testable in unit tests).
        * Fixed JUnit unit tests.
        * Some repository cleanup.
